# Changelog

All notable changes to Kortext are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and Kortext adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [5.0.0] - 2026-09-01

**v1.0 — the active project brain.** Full vision rewrite (dev/DECISIONS.md
§20): during analysis Kortext is ACTIVE — it drives your own agent CLI
(claude / codex / gemini) headlessly itself, so you never leave the panel.
On handshake completion Kortext retires; from then on it's you and your
client, governed by the approved docs and the `AGENTS.md` handover
constitution. The v3 engine stays archived under `docs/codes/`.

### Added

- **Readiness gate**: one gate at the head of the chain, so evidence that says
  nothing produces nothing. A new project is judged on its brief — a countable
  floor (skeleton lines and template placeholders are not content), then one
  engine judgment cached per brief version; an existing project on whether
  there is code to read. Blocked, the panel shows what the brief must answer
  instead of the documents it would have invented. A missing agent CLI reports
  through the same card rather than leaving Start to do nothing.
- **Scope before writing**: every workflow step carries an `n/a when`
  condition (LEGAL, GROWTH, CONTENT, DESIGN, DATABASE, API), phrased against
  the brief for a new project and against the code for an existing one. The
  step prompt decides scope first: when the condition holds the document lands
  `not-applicable` with its reasoning — a complete outcome, not a gap. What the
  inputs do not say, no document may assume.
- **Interface language in the brief**: a required section naming the language
  the product speaks to its users, and the default when there is more than one.
  It settles what CONTENT is written in, which market LEGAL covers, which
  language GROWTH optimizes for. `CONTENT.md` gains a Localization section.
- **Archive**: a project can be shelved rather than removed — the row and the
  repo both stay, and the panel folds archived projects into their own
  collapsed group instead of growing the grid forever.
- **Language split**: document prose follows the brief; section headings, code,
  identifiers, file names, commands, environment variables, table and column
  names, API paths, branch and commit conventions stay English always. Product
  copy follows the product's own interface language.
- **Analysis engine (Phase A)**: dependency-gated chain over workflow
  `inputs/outputs/approver` metadata; spawns the selected agent CLI headless
  (prompt over stdin, cwd = repo), validates exit/output/frontmatter, lands
  every document as `draft`. Up to 3 independent steps in parallel; an
  approval mid-run wakes the chain. Jobs table with stale-fail on boot and
  Retry.
- **Engine picker**: auto-detects installed CLIs (`claude`, `codex`,
  `gemini`), selectable in the header; install hints when none found.
- **Sealed layout** (§20): `.kortext/` flat root (ARCHITECTURE, STACK,
  STRUCTURE, API, DATABASE, SECURITY, DESIGN, TEST, LEGAL, GROWTH, CONTENT,
  ENVIRONMENT) + `foundation/` (BRD, PRD, TRD, PFD); `not-applicable` settles
  a dependency with reasoning. No decision log: a decision is recorded in the
  document it shapes, and the ones taken after the handshake are the client's.
- **Document review**: line-token viewer with wrapped-line merging; inline
  line thread — select a line, converse with the author persona (ephemeral,
  never saved) or drop notes; batched notes re-run the producing step.
  Action-first ordering; collapsible Core/Foundation groups.
- **Handshake screen**: completion card, copyable client starter commands,
  Kopeng promo when kopeng is absent.
- **"Kopeng'e aktar"**: one plan job splits the work into `.kopeng/`
  (project.yaml, versions/, epics/, tasks/ with rich bodies — description,
  functional requirements, user flow, UI requirements, technical notes,
  acceptance criteria; `assignee: ai|prime`, `blocked_by`/`blocks`);
  plan summary + Approve/Revise plan in the panel. The `.kopeng/` layout is
  the draft contract kopeng will adopt.
- **Add-project form**: New/Existing mode toggle (= workflow choice), native
  folder Browse, project code field, brief write/upload tabs — a user-written
  brief lands approved and the chain starts immediately.

### Changed

- A brief written in the add form lands **approved only if it can start the
  analysis**; a thinner one lands as a draft, so the panel never shows an
  approved BRD next to "not enough to start". `Add` is now `Initialize`, and
  `Insert example` joins the Write/Upload tab group as `Example`.
- The document skeletons drop the unused `reviewer:` frontmatter slot; nothing
  ever read it. The three foundation skeletons (PRD, TRD, PFD) gain the
  `approver:` their workflow step already declared.
- `Example` hands over a `BRD.md` to edit and bring back through Upload instead
  of overwriting the editor, and switches to the Upload tab so the round trip is
  visible. It carries no frontmatter — kortext writes that on Initialize.
- Archive asks before it acts, like Restart and Remove, and the three project
  actions are separated and coloured by what they cost: restart blue, archive
  green, remove red.
- The Start/Pause button follows what is actually happening rather than the
  paused flag: Pause only while a step runs, Start or Continue whenever the
  chain is stopped — including a chain the gate refused — and nothing at all
  once every document is settled. The nav line says which of those it is.
- A closed gate with no brief to open — an existing project, or a missing CLI —
  offers **Check again** rather than ending in a dead end.

### Removed

- **`DECISIONS.md`** — the decision log covered decisions taken along the way,
  and the way starts after Kortext retires, so it owned a file it could only
  fill during analysis and then had to hope someone else kept. A decision now
  lives in the document it shapes, and `foundation/PFD.md` carries the
  consolidated list. A legacy `memory/decisions.md` is still migrated rather
  than deleted.
- **Reports** (routes, generation, templates) — no reports feature in v2.
- **Agent-facing surface**: MCP server (`/mcp`), `/api/agent/*` REST
  fallback, request queue (`requests` table dropped on migration) — the
  external agent no longer talks to Kortext during analysis; Kortext drives
  the engine itself, and after the handshake the repo files are the whole
  interface.
- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` and `zod` dependencies.
- Plan/TODO leftovers (`backlog.yaml` + `TODO.md` gate) — replaced by the
  `.kopeng/` split.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-06-06

**Onboarding overhaul + CLI redesign.** Single large release that bundles Phases
11-13 (merged on `main`, never published because `kortext@3.0.0` shipped with an
EADDRINUSE silent-fail bug) plus the UI UAT polish round and the per-project-port
CLI redesign decided in
[development/DECISIONS.md Bölüm 0](development/DECISIONS.md).

### Added

- **Per-project-port CLI** (v3.1). New 9-command surface — `start` / `stop` /
  `pause` / `list` / `remove` / `purge` / `update` / `doctor` / `help` — backed by
  a global registry (`~/.kortext/projects.json`, atomic temp-file + rename writes)
  that maps each project to a stable port (3200+) and tracks one detached
  prod-mode daemon per project (spawn / pid-liveness / kill). Multiple projects
  run in parallel and survive restarts (bookmarked ports stay stable). `remove`
  drops the registry entry but keeps `.kortext/` on disk; `purge` deletes it after
  a confirmation prompt. The legacy mock-executor workflow runner moved off the
  main surface to `kortext dev:run <workflow-id>`; `serve` / `init` remain as dev
  commands. Friendly postinstall pointer that never blocks `npm i -g`.
- **UI UAT polish** (board data wiring). Epic column (`?limit=500`), assignee
  derivation (`assigneeOf`), semver-sorted version filter with smallest-unfinished
  default, Dashboard activity timeline (`GET /api/activity`), in-app "New task"
  form (POST accepts `version`), item comments (drawer + timeline share one feed),
  working Assignee filter, Agents panel (active-agent derivation with status),
  refreshed persona icon set, and dependency display (`dependenciesOf` + drawer
  Dependencies section).
- **`.kortext/` encapsulation** (Faz 12.1). All framework files live under
  `.kortext/` (`.git/`-style), keeping the project root clean — only
  `AGENTS.md`, `.env*`, `.gitignore` remain at the top level.
- **Global runtime** (Faz 12.2). `agents/`, `workflows/`, `rules/` are now read
  directly from the installed `node_modules/kortext/` package, no longer copied
  per project. `kortext init` only seeds `templates/` content. Package upgrade
  automatically propagates updated personas/workflows.
- **`templates/` package** (Faz 12.3). 38 skeleton files seeded by `init`:
  `AGENTS.md`, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, `foundation/{BRD,PRD,TRD,PFD}.md`,
  `backlogs/{B,D,E,H,S,T}XX-*.md` (6 templates), `memory/{handover,decisions,
  learned}.md`, `references/` (13 ALL-CAPS files), `reports/` (8 scope
  templates).
- **`.kortext/foundation/` category** (Faz 13). New directory for analysis
  phase's frozen outputs: `BRD.md` (Business Requirements / blueprint),
  `PRD.md` (Product Requirements), `TRD.md` (Technical Requirements), and
  `PFD.md` (Product Foundation — consolidated analysis report). Separate from
  `references/` (canonical, lived-with) and `reports/` (per-run records).
- **ALL-CAPS references rename** (Faz 13). 13 reference files now use the
  canonical-source signal pattern: `ACCESS.md`, `API.md`, `CONTENT.md`,
  `DATABASE.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `ENVIRONMENT.md`, `GLOSSARY.md`, `GROWTH.md`,
  `LEGAL.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `STACK.md`, `STRUCTURE.md`, `TEST.md`. ALL-CAPS
  matches AGENTS.md / README.md / LICENSE convention.
- **Per-file reports + `reports_index`** (Faz 12.5). Monolithic
  `test-reports.md`, `delivery-reports.md`, etc. split into per-file
  `<scope>_<slug>_<YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM>.md`. SQL table `reports_index`
  (`id, scope, slug, file_path, author, status, tags, related_item,
  created_at`) backs filter/sort/search. `outputIndexer` automatically
  populates the index on every successful step.
- **Output placeholder syntax** (Faz 13). Workflow body can declare
  `outputs: .kortext/reports/test-reports_<slug>_<ts>.md`;
  `server/engine/output-resolver.ts` resolves `<slug>` → `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*`
  and `<ts>` → `\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}-\d{4}` at runtime. 4 CLI executors and
  worker-pool safety guards wire through the resolver.
- **Workflow/persona SQL index** (Faz 12.8). New tables `workflow_steps`
  (with `step_index, phase, persona_handle, approver, parallel_with_json`)
  and `personas` (with `handle, source_path, body_md`). Markdown remains the
  source of truth; engine boot parses and upserts. Parse-time FK validation:
  unknown `+ajan` reference is a fatal throw. `+prime` synthetic row added
  at boot (no `agents/prime.md` file).
- **Handover rotation + TOC engine** (Faz 12.6). `handover.md` rotates at 5
  entries or 30 KB threshold; previous content moves to
  `handover-<YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM>.md` in the same directory. TOC engine
  (`markdown-sync.writeDecision/writeLearned` → `toc-updater.updateToc()`)
  maintains `## İçindekiler` sections atomically. `kortext archive handover`
  CLI for manual trigger.
- **Prompt cache discipline** (Faz 12.7). `claude-cli-executor.ts` sends the
  persona body via `--append-system-prompt` (stable prefix) and per-step
  runtime data (runId, stepId, timestamp) via user message. Net effect:
  ~90% input-token reduction on cache hits.
  `--exclude-dynamic-system-prompt-sections` skips the user's global
  `~/.claude/settings.json` dynamic prompt.
- **Onboarding wizard** (Faz 11). Single-page form in the dashboard: project
  name, project code (slug A-Z0-9, 2-6), project type (new/existing), target
  platform chips, blueprint markdown dropzone (≤100KB), GitHub repo
  (optional), executor selection (Mock/Claude/AGY + binary path). Submit
  posts to `/api/blueprint` → writes `.kortext/foundation/BRD.md` +
  `.kortext/project.json` → triggers the workflow chain.
- **Backlog UI + readonly editors** (Faz 12.9). Board screen with 6 status
  columns (Epic / To Do / In Progress / Test / Review / Done) and
  `+ New Item` modal. Settings panes (Agents/Rules/Workflows) render markdown
  read-only (writable editor deferred to v3.2).
- **`kortext archive` subcommand** (Faz 12.6). Manual handover rotation
  trigger; complements the automatic rotation in the maintenance cycle.
- **Per-step output safety wiring** (Faz 13). `outputIndexer` callback slot
  in `SafetyGuards` keeps the engine-adapter boundary clean: worker-pool
  doesn't import the reports indexer directly; `server/index.ts` boot wires
  the optional callback.

### Changed

- **Workflow lifecycle redesign** (DECISIONS Bölüm 5). The development/test
  lifecycle was reworked around an engine-owns-mechanics model: columns
  `to_do → in_progress → test → review → done` (no `merge` column); 5
  planning-selected gates (`code_review`, `quality_control`, `security_control`,
  `design_review`, `uat`) run in parallel in `test`, the engine joins them;
  `assignee` (developer) stays fixed for the item's whole life. `development-cycle`
  shortened to end at `test`; `deployment-cycle` reframed as an environment
  ladder (item→dev, epic→staging, version→preprod, approval→main+prod).
  Engine/schema implementation deferred (DECISIONS §5.9).
- **`incident-pipeline` split into `rollback-pipeline` + `hotfix-pipeline`.**
  The merged pipeline used mutually-exclusive paths joined at a shared closing
  step via multi-producer fan-in; since the engine only counts `succeeded`
  steps as done, the non-selected path stayed skipped and the closure
  deadlocked. Split into two independent straight-line flows (no conditional
  branch needed); path chosen by `!rollback` / `!hotfix`. Found by 15-agent
  adversarial verification (DECISIONS §5.12).
- **Honest workflow chain markers.** Four workflows (`test-cycle`,
  `deployment-cycle`, `spike-pipeline`, former `incident`) had `Sonraki akış`
  lines the parser silently dropped (prose before the backtick → null). Their
  transitions are conditional by design (milestone/approval-gated), so they were
  rewritten as `**Sonraki:**` notes stating "conditional, engine job (§5.9), not
  auto-chain". Working autonomous chain unchanged: analysis → planning →
  environment-setup → development-cycle → test-cycle.
- **Workflow gate detection** (Faz 13). Replaced `> [!NOTE] RAPOR HAZIR`
  callout-based gates with approver-based detection. Parser now reads
  `step.approver === '+prime'` from the step's sub-bullets and auto-generates
  the gate in `flushStep()`. Callout blocks are consumed and ignored
  (backward-compat shim) but no longer produce gates. Result: single signal
  source (sub-bullet only), less prompt-token noise, callout-cosmetic-vs-gate
  ambiguity resolved.
- **`docs/` → `development/` rename** (Faz 13). Internal docs folder renamed
  to reflect "developer-side documentation" intent. 22 old files consolidated
  into 6 canonical docs + `concepts/`: `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DECISIONS.md`,
  `DESIGN.md`, `HANDOVER.md`, `TODO.md`, `UAT-GUIDE.md`. `development/` is
  codebase-only — excluded from the npm package via `.npmignore`.
- **Frontmatter standards** (v3.1 spec §5). 4 separate frontmatter standards
  by file nature: References (`status, author, reviewer, approver`), Reports
  (`status, author, reviewer, updated_at`), Handover (entry-level frontmatter
  per `## Handover: <id>` block), ADR + Learned (section-level header + TOC
  auto-update).
- **`reviewer:` workflow lines removed** (Faz 13). 2 pre-existing `reviewer:
  +X` lines (design-system, api-reference) were passive metadata — engine
  doesn't run reviewers at runtime. Removed to clear noise. Agent-to-agent
  review pattern deferred to v3.2.
- **`approver:` discipline tightened** (Faz 13). Gate-producing files
  (blueprint, LEGAL, GROWTH, PRD, CONTENT, STACK, DESIGN, PFD, etc.) keep
  `approver: +prime`. Metadata-only files (SECURITY, DATABASE, API, TRD,
  TEST) had `approver:` removed entirely — engineering-manager records them
  without a `+prime` gate.

### Removed

- **`maintenance-cycle` workflow** (DECISIONS §5.12). Its outputs (debt review,
  new debt/bug, dependency/security scan results) all flow into planning +
  backlog + development; a standalone "maintenance mode" is an anti-pattern in
  an autonomous system where the backlog is always live.
- **`merge` board column** (DECISIONS §5.2). Merge is now the engine's
  mechanical closing step after `review` passes, not a separate human-facing
  column.
- **`skills/` category** (Faz 11.4). Persona body's `capabilities` field
  covers the same ground — removed `templates/skills/` and
  `required-skills.md`.
- **v2 Python+Bash migration script** (Faz 11.4). `bin/migrate-legacy-backlog.ts`
  removed — no v2 users to migrate.
- **`> [!INFO]` callouts** (Faz 11.4). Unified to single YAML frontmatter
  standard. Duplicate metadata signal eliminated.
- **`> [!NOTE] RAPOR HAZIR` callouts** (Faz 13). Replaced by approver-based
  gate detection. Backward-compat shim consumes these blocks silently.
- **Repo-root `/AGENTS.md`** (Faz 13). Was stale with v3.0 paths. Removed —
  `templates/AGENTS.md` is the canonical version (gets copied to project
  root at `init` time).
- **`HANDOVER-v3.md` from npm package** (Faz 13). Now lives at
  `development/HANDOVER.md` and is excluded from publish (`.npmignore`).
- **Repo-root `/.env.example`** (Faz 13). Duplicate + stale path. Removed —
  `templates/.env.example` is canonical.

### Fixed

- **`app.listen()` EADDRINUSE silent fail** (HANDOVER #51, v3.0.1 debt). The
  server now attaches an explicit `error` handler: a clashing port prints a clear
  message (which project/port + how to resolve via `kortext list` / `kortext
  stop`) and exits 1, instead of silently skipping the listening callback and
  serving "Cannot GET /". Matters more under per-project-port where two `start`s
  can race for a port.

### Deferred to v3.2+ (intentional)

- Light theme variant
- Mobile responsive (currently 1280px+ optimized)
- A11y aria attributes (focus states exist; aria missing)
- i18n implementation (Settings has selection but it's static)
- LocalStorage persistence
- ⌘K command palette (currently disabled, "soon" badge)
- Reviewer-as-step runtime (agent-to-agent review pattern)
- Settings/Agents/Workflows/Rules write editor (currently read-only)
- `learned.md` topical split (single file for now; v3.2 splits at 50KB+)

## [3.0.0] — 2026-05-22

First public release of Kortext: a TypeScript runtime that lets AI agent teams
(Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI) run software projects autonomously. SQLite
state store, React dashboard, per-task git worktrees, and a built-in Model
Context Protocol server.

### Added

- **TypeScript runtime** (Node 22+). Single package, ESM, `better-sqlite3`,
  Express 5, Zod, Vitest. Strict mode across the board.
- **SQLite state store** (`server/db/`). 13 tables — `backlog_items`,
  `contexts`, `locks`, `handovers`, `sessions`, `decisions_index`,
  `pending_questions`, `audit_log`, `runs`, `run_steps`, `runtime_artifacts`,
  `notifications_sent`, `secrets_scan_results`. Migrations live in
  `server/db/migrations/*.sql` and are copied into `dist/` at build time.
- **Pipeline engine** (`server/engine/`). Parses `workflows/*.md` into a typed
  DAG, performs Kahn-style cycle detection, runs steps through a pull-ready
  worker pool with configurable concurrency (default 3), and short-circuits
  the remainder of the graph on first failure.
- **Per-task git worktrees** (`server/engine/worktree.ts`). Every run gets its
  own `.kortext/worktrees/run-<id>` branch namespaced as `kortext/run-<id>`.
  Successes can be merged and the worktree removed; failures are moved to a
  timestamped quarantine directory and the branch is preserved for postmortem.
- **CLI executors for Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini**
  (`server/engine/executors/`). Each has its own file (no shared abstract
  base); all spawn shell-free, pipe the persona prompt via stdin, and write
  per-step logs with declared `outputs:` verification.
- **Output safety**. `server/safety/secret-scanner.ts` runs on every successful
  step's declared outputs and log; findings flip the step to `failed`.
  `harmful-output-filter.ts` ships as a configurable placeholder for v3.1+.
- **Autonomous orchestrator** (`server/orchestrator/`). Pipeline chaining via
  `nextWorkflowId`, blueprint watcher (`status: approved` → trigger),
  multi-channel notification dispatcher (Slack + Telegram, deduped), and an
  approval queue surfaced to the dashboard.
- **Mid-run gate pause/resume**. Workers stop at workflow gates; the queue
  resolves the gate with `decision: approve | reject` and the run resumes
  from the same worktree.
- **Persona + workflow content layer** (`server/engine/persona-registry.ts`,
  `server/engine/workflow-loader.ts`). 14 personas and 12 workflows are
  authored as markdown — runtime parses them in-memory. Hot reload on disk
  change.
- **Doctor / consistency checks**. `kortext doctor` validates workflow ↔
  persona references, lock state, and backlog health. Exposed as
  `GET /api/doctor` and an MCP tool.
- **Item lifecycle**. `kortext-item-start`, `kortext-item-transition`, and
  `kortext-backlog-add` as TypeScript commands; every status change writes
  an audit row and a `chore(kortext): <action> <id>` commit.
- **React 19 dashboard** (Vite + Tailwind v4 + TanStack Router). Six main
  routes (Dashboard, Board, Memory, Reports, References) plus eight settings
  sub-panes. Bell, toast notifications, terminal panel, and timeline drawer
  are global overlays. Persona Markdown editor is inline (PUT + hot reload).
- **REST API**. `GET /api/runs`, `/api/handovers`, `/api/backlog`,
  `/api/personas` (GET/PUT), `/api/workflows`, `/api/doctor`,
  `/api/docs/:scope[/:file]` with an allow-listed scope
  (`references | reports | memory | rules | workflows`).
- **MCP server**. 16 tools registered through a `createKortextMcpServer(deps)`
  factory. Stdio transport for Claude Code / Cursor; SSE transport mounted on
  the same Express instance under `/mcp/sse` + `/mcp/messages` with
  per-session `McpServer` instances.
- **CLI**. `kortext init | serve | start | approve | status | logs | cleanup |
  doctor | mcp` with `--help` and `--version`. `bin/kortext.js` is a dual-mode
  shim that prefers compiled `dist/bin/kortext.js` and falls back to `tsx` in
  development.
- **CI**. GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/kortext-ci.yml`) running
  Node 22 lint → typecheck → test → build → compiled CLI smoke on every push
  and PR to `main`, with `cancel-in-progress` concurrency.

### Compatibility

- **Node** ≥ 22.0.0. `better-sqlite3` ≥ 12 requires the Node 26 V8 ABI, which
  is included in Node 22+.
- **TypeScript** ≥ 5.7 for `allowImportingTsExtensions` +
  `rewriteRelativeImportExtensions`.
- **Git** ≥ 2.30 (worktree subcommands).
